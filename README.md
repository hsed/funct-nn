# funct-nn

## Description

An implementation of a general vanilla neural network architecture in F#. Any arbitrary number of input/output features, layers and nodes per layer are supported.

## Instructions

1. Install the [.Net Core framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started).
2. If you are on windows skip this step, if you are on Linux run `sudo apt install libplplot-dev` or an equivalent command for macOS to install the PLplot library.
3. Clone this repo and run `dotnet run` in the root directory
4. Select an appropriate option for plotting the final result. Saving as a picture should work for all operating systems.


## Tested On
- Windows 10: VS Code + F# Language Support + .Net Core Framework 2.1.4
